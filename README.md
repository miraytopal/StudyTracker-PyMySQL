# StudyTracker-PyMySQL

This is a study tracker to keep and analyze your study information.

To get started, install the library with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) :
```
pip install pymysql
```
First of all, you need to add your study categories to the system. Afterwards, you can start adding your study records based on the categories you saved. The system automatically assigns a current date to these. In this way, you can access your study records with category and date information when you want.

### Benefits 

The system allows you to :

- Customize the system according to your own study categories
- Analyze your study records by category, date or both
- Delete your categories when you don't want to use them again (avoid allocating unnecessary memory)

### Future Works :rocket: :
